# Booki
### Responsive website for Booki

Before approving a final version of the design the company has decided to create a prototype.
The mockup must be HTML and CSS only (no JavaScript).

UX/UI outlines design specifications (based on the principles of Material Design) as well as some of the technical rules that need to be abided by:

## Functional Specifications
● Users will be able to search for accommodation in the town of their
choosing. The search field is an input field, so users will need to be
able to edit this. This field should be part of a form so that it can be
validated by W3C. The search part does not need to be functional

● All maps for accommodation and activities should be entirely
clickable (and not just the title). For the time being the links are
empty.

● The filters should change appearance during mouseover. I’ll leave
the exact effect up to you, I’ve not had time to think about it. But it
doesn’t need to be functional

● The words, “Accommodation” and “Activities”, which are part of the
header, are links. They should lead to the “Accommodation in
Marseille” and “Activities in Marseille” sections, respectively


## Technical Specifications
● Two mockups were made: one for desktop and the other a mobile
version. The website will also have to be adapted for tablet formats.
For tablets we are free to make the necessary changes.

● Regarding breakpoints, we agreed with UI designer that we would
use 992px and 768px.

● You need to do the embedding for computers first (i.e. desktop first)
before moving on to the tablet version and then the mobile version.

● The icons must come from the Font Awesome library.

● The colors of the chart are blue (#0065FC), a lighter version of this
blue (#DEEBFF), and gray for the background (#F2F2F2)

● The font used for the website must be Raleway.

● It is important that we use pixels and percentages rather than REMs
and EMs.

● It is important that we use Flexbox rather than Grid because it’s the
library our team knows best.

● You should not use any CSS frameworks (such as BootStrap or
TailwindCSS) or pre-processors (such as Sass or Less)

● It is important to use semantic tags (such as “main”, “header”, “nav”,
etc.)

● The code should be valid according to the W3C HTML and CSS
validators

● The mockup should be compatible with the latest versions of Google
Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. You should test the prototype on these
two browsers
